Function: The Interactive Combined Plot Generator script, using R's tidyverse and plotly libraries, produces an interactive plot showcasing boxplots for every dataset column, revealing data distribution insights.

Interactive Plot: The resulting plot is an amalgamation of boxplots representing each column's data distribution. Interactive features allow hovering over boxpoints to view corresponding values.

Usage: Load the necessary tidyverse and plotly packages, read your dataset, reshape data using pivot_longer(), generate an interactive combined plot using plot_ly(), export it using saveWidget(), and execute the script in an R environment for an interactive boxplot visualization.

Interactive Combined Plot Generator

This script generates an interactive combined plot using the tidyverse and plotly libraries in R. The plot displays boxplots for each column of a given dataset, providing insights into the distribution of data.
Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure you have the tidyverse and plotly libraries installed. If they are not already installed, you can do so by running the following commands:

R

if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("tidyverse")
}

if (!requireNamespace("plotly", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("plotly")
}

Usage

    Load necessary packages: The script requires the tidyverse and plotly libraries to be loaded. This can be done using the following commands:

    R

library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

Read your data: Replace 'test.txt' in the following line with the actual path to your data file. The data should be in a tab-separated format with headers.

R

data <- read.delim("/path/to/your/data/file.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

Reshape data for plotting: The script reshapes the data using the pivot_longer() function from the tidyverse package. This step is necessary to prepare the data for boxplot generation.

R

data_long <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Column", values_to = "Value")

Generate the interactive combined plot:

    The script creates an interactive combined plot using plot_ly() from the plotly package.
    The plot consists of boxplots for each column, with boxpoints displayed and hover text showing the corresponding value.

Export the plot:

    The interactive HTML plot will be saved as 'interactive_combined_plot.html' in the current working directory.

    If the htmlwidgets library is not already installed, you can install it using:

    R

if (!requireNamespace("htmlwidgets", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("htmlwidgets")
}

Then, use the saveWidget() function to export the plot:

R

        library(htmlwidgets)
        saveWidget(combined_plot, "interactive_combined_plot.html")

    Run the script:
        Run the script in an R environment to generate the interactive combined plot.

Example

For a quick demonstration, you can use the provided example data file 'test.txt'.
Note

This script creates boxplots for each column of the dataset, providing insights into the distribution of data. Customize the visualization and layout options as needed.
