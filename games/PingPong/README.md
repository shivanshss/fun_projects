# Python Ping Pong Game

## Ping Pong Game
## Description

This is a simple Ping Pong game created in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game features two paddles, one controlled by the player on the left and the other controlled by the player on the right. The objective is to bounce the ball back and forth between the paddles without letting it pass your paddle. Each time the ball passes a paddle and hits the screen edge behind it, the opposing player scores a point.
## Features

    Paddle controls:
        Player A: W (Up), S (Down)
        Player B: Up Arrow (Up), Down Arrow (Down)
    Realistic ball physics with bounce sounds
    Score display for both players at the top of the screen

## How to Play

    Run the Python script using your preferred Python interpreter (e.g., Python 3).
    Player A can move their paddle up with the 'W' key and down with the 'S' key.
